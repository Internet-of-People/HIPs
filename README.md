# HIPs
Hydra Improvement Proposals
## Contributing
- First review the [HIP-1-Process Guidelines for submitting a HIP](HIPS/hip-1.md). 
- Open a new issue and start a discussion related to your HIP. The number assigned to the issue will be also your HIP number.
- Clone the repository and write your HIP. Follow the [HIP-Template](HIP-template.md) structure and guidelines. 
- Submit a Pull Request to IOP's [HIPs repository](https://github.com/Internet-of-People/HIPs). Before submitting a pull request to the official repository try to obtain consensus from the community and the team (discussion log under opened issue).

When your Pull Request is merged you will continue to work on the AIP together with the AIP editor.
